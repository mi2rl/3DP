# Safety devices with 3D printing
*	With the pandemic of COVID 19, the health workers all over the world are scrambling with the shortage of safety devices such as masks as well as medical devices.
*	To overcome the novel corona virus pandemic, this project is aimed to share the ideas and know-hows of making newly developed devices - which not previously existed, but should be exist -  as well as the ways of making up the weak points of existing devices(such as not-fitting-masks or should-contact-hand-sanitizers) which are necessary under this circumstance.

*	Uploaded STL files are produced or modified with 3D modelling program( 3-matics (Materialise), Solidworks s/w)
*	Download or Use of uploaded STL files are free and **highly recommended**.
*	For further information or questions, please contact via email: dyhong.89@gmail.com

#### *	This project is run by **Medical Imaging and Intelligent Reality Lab in Asan Medical Center(AMC-MI2RL)**, Seoul, Korea.


# Medical device reverse engineering
*	Various ideas to back in  COVID-19 pandemic can be realized with 3D printing.
*	Unmet needs of frontline healthcare workers for medical devices can be fulfilled.
*	It can be done with following protocol,
	1.	get 3D image from CT or 3D scanner
	2.	make parts of the same shape or customized parts
	3.	print with appropriate 3D printing material




## 1. Customized mask (Human-specific mask)

*	This is to product personal customized mask using 3D scanning
*	Merits: cost effective, replaceable HEPA filter, sterilization available, face-fit customized(can reduce the air flow gap)
*	Printing with flexible materials (e.g. TPU in FDM) is recommended.
*	Original design of AMC-MI2RL.
*	STL link: Preparing

## 2. Forearm door opener

*	We propose new way of door opening. This can reduce the chance of  potential exposure occuring when touching the contaminated door or door handle surface with hand.
*	Demo video: https://youtu.be/Ut0sYw5X-XA
*	We refered modelling of STARARASYS Corp., and modified with additional modeling of MI2RL to improve user convenience and stability of installation.
*	Printing with robust materials (e.g. ABS, PLA in FDM) are recommended.

## 3. Portable Untact Tool; PUT

*	With this small device, people can minimize the chance of potential exposure reducing the hand contact to the possibly contaminated surfaces such as door handles(when opening/closing the door) or elevator buttons.
*	How to use: Fix the index finger on the "fixed finger" part to use it. The "pressing button" is used to press the elevator button, etc., and in the "keyring holder" part, the portability has been increased so that it can be worn on name card necklace of keyring. "open/close door" part can be used when the open or close door.
*	This device is developed with AMC-MI2RL original modelling 
*	Printing with robust materials (e.g. ABS, PLA in FDM) are recommended.

## 4. Size-Adjustable Ear Guard

*	Wearing a mask for many hours can cause pain behind the ear. This device is developed to lessen that kind of pain and also reduce the gap between face and the mask by size control.
*	Merit: Made in two type  
–	Type1 : putting on around the ear, projections make resistance with hairs so that not slip, size adjustable for face size (3-step).  
–	Type2: not putting on the ear, without projections so that the contact surface on the neck is not uncomfortable, adjustable for face size (3-step).
*	Printing with flexible materials (e.g. TPU in FDM) are recommended.

## 5. Face/eye protector

*	This device is developed as a tool for protecting eyes and face from infectious virus (respiratory droplets) by covering whole face.
*	It can be used with attachment of transparent acrylic sheet (OHP film) onto the 3d printed frame.
*	3D printed frame + Transparent Acrylic sheets OHP film.  
	* OHP films can be attached(holded) onto the frame through the holes with 4-hole punch. (Spec: 67*80*67 mm)
*	Printing with robust materials (e.g. ABS, PLA in FDM) are recommended.
*	Original design of AMC-MI2RL.
*	Improvements: Resized to fit normal heads, flattened the surface that touches the skin so that there is no pain, and fixed with a sponge.

  ## 6.Automatic hand dispenser housing

*	This device is developed as a housing unit for [DON’T push dispenser](https://github.com/mi2rl/DONT_dispenser).
*	It can be used with various size of hand sanitizers. 
*	Original design of AMC-MI2RL.
*	Printing with robust materials (e.g. ABS, PLA in FDM, CJP) are recommended.
